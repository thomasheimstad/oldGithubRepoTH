Alle hans 74 musikkverker, eller opus som de også kalles, skal spilles live og i rekkefølge på NRK. Gjennom nærmere <strong>30 timer</strong> nonstop, skal hele Griegs musikalske produksjon fremføres av de fremste norske musikere.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Arrangementet blir et storstilt musikalsk portrett av Edvard Griegs berømte musikk, en presentasjon av orkestre og enkeltutøvere i dagens norske musikkliv og en storstilt folkefest der hele landet kan delta. Dette blir årets store sakte-TV satsing fra NRK. NRK´s sakte-TV har samlet millioner av seere de siste årene. De tar alle flater i bruk og gjør Grieg minutt for minutt til årets store mediebegivenhet på musikkfronten. All musikken spilles live! Det betyr at det blir nattkonserter i <strong>Grieghallen</strong>, døgnåpent på <strong>Troldhaugen</strong> og folkefest hele sommernatten mellom 15. og 16. juni. I Oslo sitter også Kringkastingsorkesteret parat i <strong>Store Studio</strong>, og sprer feststemningen til hovedstaden.\n                  </p>\n                  <h2>Hvordan kan jeg delta i festen?</h2>\n                  <p>\n                    Grieg minutt for minutt er <strong>åpent og gratis for alle!</strong>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Nam tempus tristique eros vel aliquet.

verket. Han omtalte senere verket som «elevmessig» og at det hadde vært best om det hadde vært «..overlatt til fullstendig glemsel».  </p>\\n<p>Høsten 1858 reiste en ung norsk student med dampskipet fra Bergen til Hamburg, medbrakt noter, klær og personlige eiendeler. Ferden gikk videre med tog til Leipzig, der han skulle bli kunstner. Med Ole Bull som inspirator og med sine foreldres velsignelse reiste den 15 år gamle Edvard Grieg nå hjemmefra for å begynne på sitt voksne liv.</p>\\n<p>Den unge Grieg ble tatt opp som elev ved det berømte Musikkonservatoriet i Leipzig, og hadde store forventninger til studiet. Herfra skulle han komme hjem til Norge «som en heksemester i tonernes rike». Men den rigide og konservative undervisningen passet dårlig for Grieg. Riktignok var han som barn vant til at moren, hans første pianolærer, var en skarp iakttager, og et korrektiv til hans drømmerier ved instrumentet. Men etter en tid med sin første pianolærer i Leipzig, gikk Grieg rett til konservatoriets direktør og forlangte å bli fritatt fra Louis Plaidys undervisning. Et dristig grep av en nykommer. Grieg selv innrømmet senere at han i begynnelsen var en lat elev, og at hans lærer hadde rett da han kastet notene gjennom rommet og med tordnende stemme utbrøt: «Gå hjem og øv!».</p>\\n<p>Hans nye lærer, Schumann-vennen Ernst Ferdinand Wenzel, satte et større mot i Grieg, og han fikk også ta timer hos den berømte Ignaz Moscheles. Hos ham fikk Grieg innstudere «et dusinvis av Beethovens sonater», og Moscheles’ egne etyder. Brikkene falt på plass og den unge Grieg fikk gode skussmål.</p>\\n<p>Resten er musikkhistorie. En stor del av Griegs komposisjoner er viet pianoet. Ti hefter med lyriske stykker, 66 i alt, har blitt stående som hans musikalske livshistorie. Flere opus med folketonebearbeidelser, den store G-mollballaden, Holbergsuiten og – ikke minst – den hyppig spilte Klaverkonserten i a-moll har satt Griegs navn på det musikalske verdenskartet.</p>\\n<p>Grieg gikk hjem og øvde. Men opplevelsene av studietiden var blandet, og han hevdet senere at han kom hjem fra Leipzig «omtrent like dum, som jeg var kommet derind». Helt sant var nok ikke dette, studieårene ga ham rike muligheter for å ta til seg av byens rike kulturliv. De mange konsertbesøkene ble svært viktige, og «…utviklede min ånd og min musikalske dømmekraft i høieste grad». Men først i København-årene som fulgte fikk hans fantasi fritt spillerom, og han kunne for alvor søke etter en egen musikalsk identitet. Motgangen ble en kilde til å stole på egen kraft, og til å arbeide selvstendig.</p>\",\"timeToRead\":2,\"excerpt\":\"Verket be spilt til Griegs avgangseksamen ved konservatoriet i Leipzig i 1862, men Grieg selv var ikke fornøyd med verket.

Ninas far, Herman Hagerup og Edvards mor Gesine (født Hagerup) var søsken. Nina og søstrene hennes bodde de første årene på Haukeland gård, før de flyttet til Danmark, morens hjemland, da Nina var 8 år. Da Grieg som 20-åring kom til København tok han opp bekjentskapet med Nina, og tilbrakte mye tid i Hagerup-familien. Vennskapet med Nina skulle snart føre til forlovelse og giftermål, selv om ingen av familiene bifalt forbindelsen eller deltok i bryllupet. Nina tok sangtimer hos pedagogen Carl Helsted i København, og hennes sangtalent ble gjennom hele Edvard Griegs kunstnerliv til uvurderlig inspirasjon.  </p>\\n<p>Inspirasjonen viste seg altså allerede i Københavnårene da Seks dikt, opus 4 ble tilegnet henne.
